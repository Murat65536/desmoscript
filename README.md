# Desmoscript

Desmoscript is a programming language that compiles to Desmos graph state. It is designed to provide the features of Desmos with zero overhead and with a C-like syntax. The syntax is largely inspired by JavaScript, Rust, and Desmos itself.

## Goals of Desmoscript
- **Highly performant**&mdash; doing things the idiomatic way should incur little-to-no performance overhead. If the idiomatic way is not performant, a performant alternative should be available.
- **Easy to both write and read**&mdash; C-like syntax is familiar to most programmers, and has an emphasis on compactness. 
- **Able to be effectively used in large projects**&mdash; A proper scoping system, namespacing, and file-splitting capabilities are used to help manage complexity in large projects.
- **Catch as many errors at compile-time as possible.**
- **Allow Desmos to interface with the outside world**&mdash; An extensible macro system should allow Desmoscript to import external data&mdash; for instance, Desmoscript macros could be used to add 3D models, SVG paths, or CSV data to a Desmos graph, automatically formatted as Desmos data.
