# How to get started with Desmoscript

Tested on NodeJS version v16.13.0. **Known to not work on NodeJS version 14 and below.**

This is a fairly minimal example of Desmoscript. Try it yourself by following these steps:
1. Navigate to this folder ((repository root)/`examples/minimal`)
2. Install required NPM packages (including the `desmoscript` module):
```
npm install
```
3. Run the compiler. Due to Desmos being a web app, the compiler compiles the Desmoscript and then hosts it on a web server.
```
npm start
```
4. Go to Desmos and paste the following into the browser console. This will request the Desmos state from the Desmoscript web server and move it to the calculator:
```js
Calc.setState(await (await fetch("http://localhost:8081")).text());
```
Alternatively, you can use [this tampermonkey extension](https://gist.github.com/radian628/d89a6868f57f425f8a355467bce93eda). You will then have to put `http://localhost:8081` into the box in the bottom right and press the button.


If you want to set up a Desmoscript environment yourself, do be aware that as of right now, there are a few conditions to its use, which are currently being resolved:
- You must be using ES Modules (not CommomJS)
- You must be using a JS module (`.mjs` extension or `type: "module"` in package.json)
- You must include the `--experimental-specifier-resolution=node` argument when running this in node.
